Hi hi! Project Visualisation 2 was an assignment for the unit FIT3179 - Data Visualisation,
which aimed for students to learn to visualise existing data using Vegalite, which is used
to declare visualisations in the form of descriptive JSON formatting. This visualisation 
project analyses the people's taste in music from Spotify specifically in May 2020.
