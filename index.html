                    This is a bar chart depicting the top 10 artists (with their feature) whos track got chartered most in the top 50 globally.
                    The number of times the artist got chartered is aggregated by the frequency of the artist appearing in top 50 for every country.
                    The ranking is emphasised by the changes in depth of the colour hue.

                    This is a bar chart depicting the top 10 tracks that are chartered most in the top 50 globally. "ROCKSTAR", "Break My Heart"
                    and "ily" all have the same number of times being chartered globally, thus the three tracks share the same ranking in 10th place.
                    The ranking is also emphasised by the changes in depth of the colour hue.

                    The choropleth map represents the number of explicit songs that have been chartered on the top 50 for every country. A total of 62
                    countries have been evaluated, some countries are missing from the chart as it reflects the countries being logged in the dataset.
                    Upon visual inspection, Greece has the most number tracks (42) that are chartered and labelled as explicit. This means many people
                    in Greece prefer to listen to music with a more mature nature. On the contrary, Japan has 0 explicit songs chartered in the top 50.

            The above piecharts show the number of explicit and non-explicit tracks that were chartered for each continent. This
            is able to show the song maturity preference of people within the specific continent. Based on observation, we can conclude that there are more non-explicit tracks than explicit tracks being chartered in the top 50
            for every country. Europe, the biggest contributing continent in the dataset, has more non-explicit tracks chartered than explicit
            tracks.
